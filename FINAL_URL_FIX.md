# FINAL FIX - Double HTTPS Issue

## ðŸš¨ PROBLEM FOUND:
Your Cloudflare Worker has **double "https://"** in the webhook URL:

**WRONG:**
```javascript
const webhookUrl = "https://https://8080-cs-994417609600-default.cs-europe-west1-onse.cloudshell.dev/webhook/email";
```

**CORRECT:**
```javascript
const webhookUrl = "https://8080-cs-994417609600-default.cs-europe-west1-onse.cloudshell.dev/webhook/email";
```

## âš¡ IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Step 1: Update Cloudflare Worker
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Workers & Pages â†’ gcs-email-forwarder â†’ Edit code
3. **DELETE ALL CODE**
4. **COPY ALL CODE** from `cloudflare_worker_corrected.js`
5. **Save and Deploy**

### Step 2: Test Email Again
Send test email to: `nn@2canrescue.online`

## âœ… Your Webhook Server is Working:
From your preview URL, I can see the webhook server is running perfectly:
```json
{
  "service": "SIBOU3AZA Cloudflare Email Webhook",
  "status": "running",
  "endpoints": {
    "webhook": "https://8080-cs-994417609600-default.cs-europe-west1-onse.cloudshell.dev/webhook/email"
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
After fixing the double HTTPS issue:
1. Cloudflare Worker will successfully connect to webhook
2. Activity Log will show "Delivery Successful"
3. Emails will be processed and relayed to your recipients
4. Recipients will receive emails in their inboxes

## The Issue:
The double "https://" was causing the Worker to try connecting to an invalid URL, resulting in "Worker call failed" errors.
