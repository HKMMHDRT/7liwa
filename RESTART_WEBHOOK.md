# Restart Webhook Server - URGENT FIX

## Problem Found:
- Webhook server stopped running (0 processes)
- Port 8080 not listening
- Cloudflare can't reach webhook = "delivery failed"

## Quick Fix:

### Step 1: Kill Any Remaining Processes
```bash
./kill_port_8080.sh
```

### Step 2: Start Webhook Server
```bash
node cloudflare_webhook_server.js
```
Keep this terminal open - don't close it!

### Step 3: Test Server (New Terminal)
Open new terminal:
```bash
cd SIBOU3AZA4
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
Should return JSON response.

### Step 4: Test Email Again
Send another test email to: `nn@2canrescue.online`

## Keep Server Running:
The webhook server must stay running in Terminal 1. If you close the terminal, the server stops and emails fail.

## Alternative - Background Mode:
```bash
./kill_port_8080.sh
nohup node cloudflare_webhook_server.js > webhook_server.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > webhook_server.pid
```

## Check Status:
```bash
ps aux | grep cloudflare_webhook_server
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## The Issue:
Your webhook server was running earlier but stopped. Cloudflare Worker tries to send emails to your webhook, but gets connection refused, so it reports "delivery failed".
